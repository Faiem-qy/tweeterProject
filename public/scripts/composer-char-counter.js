//EVENTS
//input - fires when the value of an <input> or a <textarea> changes (doesnâ€™t fire for deleting in IE9). You can use keydown as a fallback in older browsers.

// keypress - fires when the user presses a key that results in printing a character on the screen. Will fire repeatedly if user holds down the key. This event will not fire for the 1.enter, 2.tab, or 3.arrow keys BUT THE KEYDOWN EVENT WOULD

//keyup - fires when the user releases a key on the keyboard.

//keydown - fires when the user presses ANY key in the keyboard. If the user holds down the key, this event fires repeatedly.


//blur - fires, for a specific DOM node, when an element loses focus.

//change - fires when the status of various form elements change. This is a better option than using the click event because clicking is not the only way users interact with the form.
